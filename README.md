## Overview

This repository contains source code for our paper "A knowledge graph-based method for drug-drug interaction prediction with contrastive learning".

We design a multi-stage feature extraction process that adeptly extracts drug-related features from the knowledge graph and construct the contrastive learning module using a multi-modal data augmentation strategy to generate high-quality embeddings for drug-drug pairs. 

## Pretrain your data Preparation

For multi-label DDI prediction, you need to unzip the compressed file in the ./data/TwoSides folder. For multi-label DDI prediction, you need to unzip the compressed file in the ./data/Drugbank folder.

Note that the knowledge graph dataset and the initial embedding data generated by pre-training are placed in the ./data/TwoSides folder.

## Environment Setting 

This code is based on Pytorch 1.8.1ï¼ŒCUDA Version 11.1. You need prepare your virtual enviroment early.

## Running the code

You can run the following command to re-implement our work:

For multi-label DDI prediction, in the ./multilabel folder; for multi-class DDI prediction, in the ./multiclass folder:

> python main.py
